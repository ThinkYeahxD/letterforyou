          Dear [receiver],<br />
          <br />
          Hey, I hope things are going well! I sent you this letter because I wanted to say that I have liked you for some time now. Back when we were at ****’s place while we were playing at the playground, that was the time when I fell for you the most. On the way home that day while we're chatting on the bus, I felt like the happiest man in the world because I was talking to the person that I like, and I just hoped that moment would last forever. I also noticed the little things about you, like how you fix your hair, the way you smile, and the vibes you give, which make me happy deep down from the inside. I know that we know little about each other, and that’s why I would like to know you better and learn more about the deeper sides of you, whether it's good or bad. Of course I am not expecting an immediate answer, and I am willing to wait for your answer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yours truly,
          <br />
          [Your name]
        </p>
